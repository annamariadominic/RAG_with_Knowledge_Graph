Non-GAAP Reconciliations
To supplement Franklin Electric’s consolidated financial statements presented on a U.S. GAAP basis, the company 
discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States. 
Non-GAAP financial measures may enhance an understanding of the company’s operations and may facilitate an analysis 
of those operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Management believes that non-
GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the 
company’s reconciliations to corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures (which are included in the tables 
accompanying this presentation), may enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the company’s past financial 
performance and prospects for the future. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in 
financial planning and to monitor business performance. This information should be considered in addition to, and not 
as substitutes for, information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Franklin Electric strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in 
their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the company may differ from similar 
measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Non-GAAP financial 
measures used in this presentation include net debt to EBITDA, free cash flow and conversion, organic sales growth, and 
return on invested capital (ROIC).

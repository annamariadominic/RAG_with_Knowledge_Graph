Once we delever, acquisitions will remain 
an important part of our growth strategy, 
and we will monitor opportunities to 
complement our existing businesses or 
expand our core competencies
We expect to maintain ample liquidity for 
our operations, including cash on the

APPENDIX
The Gorman-Rupp Company Non-GAAP Measures 
This presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial data and measures such as adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and 
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, referred to as “adjusted EBITDA”.  Adjusted earnings is net 
income excluding amortization of customer backlog, non-cash write-off of unamortized previously deferred debt financing fees, and 
refinancing costs.  Adjusted earnings per share is earnings per share excluding amortization of customer backlog per share, non-cash 
write-off of unamortized previously deferred debt financing fees per share, and refinancing costs per share.  Adjusted EBITDA is net 
income (loss) excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude amortization of customer backlog, non-
cash write-off of unamortized previously deferred debt financing, refinancing costs, and non-cash LIFO expense. Management utilizes 
these adjusted financial data and measures to assess comparative operations against those of prior periods without the distortion of 
non-comparable factors. The inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that the Company’s future 
results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which the Company has made adjustments are unusual 
or infrequent or will not recur.  Further, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from 
company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect.  The 
Gorman-Rupp Company believes that these non-GAAP financial data and measures also will be useful to investors in assessing the 
strength of the Company’s underlying operations from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to 
replace GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other 
companies. Following is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, which includes descriptions of actual adjustments made in the 
current period and the corresponding prior period.

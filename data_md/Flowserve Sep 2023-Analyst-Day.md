Forward Looking Statements & Non-GAAP Measures
This presentation includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor 
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Words or phrases such as, "may," "should," "expects," "could," "intends," "plans," "anticipates," "estimates," "believes," "forecasts," "predicts" or 
other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which include, without limitation, earnings forecasts, statements relating to our business strategy and statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans 
and strategies and anticipated developments concerning our industry, business, operations and financial performance and condition
The forward-looking statements included in this presentation are based on our current expectations, projections, estimates and assumptions. These statements are only predictions, not guarantees. Such forward-looking 
statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from what is forecast in such forward-looking statements, and 
include, without limitation, the following: the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 on our business and operations; global supply chain disruptions and the current inflationary environment could adversely affect the 
efficiency of our manufacturing and increase the cost of providing our products to customers; a portion of our bookings may not lead to completed sales, and our ability to convert bookings into revenues at acceptable profit 
margins; changes in global economic conditions and the potential for unexpected cancellations or delays of customer orders in our reported backlog; our dependence on our customers’ ability to make required capital investment 
and maintenance expenditures; if we are not able to successfully execute and realize the expected financial benefits from any restructuring and realignment initiatives, our business could be adversely affected; the substantial 
dependence of our sales on the success of the oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management industries; the adverse impact of volatile raw materials prices on our products and operating margins; economic, 
political and other risks associated with our international operations, including military actions, trade embargoes, epidemics or pandemics or changes to tariffs or trade agreements that could affect customer markets, particularly 
North African, Latin American, Asian and Middle Eastern markets and global oil and gas producers, and non-compliance with U.S. export/re-export control, foreign corrupt practice laws, economic sanctions and import laws and 
regulations; increased aging and slower collection of receivables, particularly in Latin America and other emerging markets; our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including in hyperinflationary countries 
such as Venezuela and Argentina; potential adverse consequences resulting from litigation to which we are a party, such as litigation involving asbestos-containing material claims; expectations regarding acquisitions and the 
integration of acquired businesses; the potential adverse impact of an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; our dependence upon third-party suppliers whose failure to perform timely could 
adversely affect our business operations; the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we operate; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; potential work stoppages and other labor matters; access to public and 
private sources of debt financing; our inability to protect our intellectual property in the U.S., as well as in foreign countries; obligations under our defined benefit pension plans; our internal control over financial reporting may not 
prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud; the recording of increased deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results; our information technology infrastructure could be subject to service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks 
or network security breaches, which could disrupt our business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information; ineffective internal controls could impact the accuracy and timely reporting of our business 
and financial results; and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All forward-looking statements included in this presentation are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain discrete items 
present useful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods, providing investors with a clearer view of the underlying trends of the business.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in 
making financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.  Throughout our materials we refer to non-GAAP measures as “Adjusted.”  Non-GAAP financial measures, which 
may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other companies, should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We have provided tables in the appendix that reconcile these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures.

during their industrial processes
• To meet their own ESG goals and 
more stringent regulations, 
customers need to reduce or 
eliminate their flaring practices
• The Flowserve flare gas recovery 
system provides the ability to recover 
waste gas and reuse it in other plant 
processes as fuel or feedstock
• The full flare gas recovery system can

2027 Financial Target Assumptions
All figures exclude any impact from potential acquisitions, including Velan. Please see Appendix for key target assumptions. 
* Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted EPS are Non-GAAP figures. Please refer to Appendix for historical reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted figures
Key assumptions include:  no significant macroeconomic, pandemic, geopolitical or terrorist-related disruptions that could have a material impact on our 
business and industry; ongoing modestly positive global GDP growth; inflation and interest rates at current levels or below; commodity prices, including crude 
oil, around current levels or above; foreign exchange rates at approximate current levels; organic performance (i.e. excludes impact of potential acquisitions or 
divestures); customers’ capital and maintenance spending generally at current levels or above; and, limited impact from trade agreements and associated tariffs.  
Flowserve also encourages the reading of its “Risk Factors” as disclosed in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for other factors that 
could impact our forward-looking targets.
